# TEST TASK TREE-MENU
________
Simple and understandable. You add new menus and items to each menu in Django admin and they appear on the main page automatically, you just choose what menu to go and then you are being redirected to the required URL.

To not waste your time I have turned around my app with docker&docker-compose with YOUR PREFERABLE DB(POSTGRESQL). So there are some steps to have this project on your local machine:


```
git clone https://github.com/Povladislav/Tree.git
```
```
pipenv shell
```
```
sudo docker-compose build
```
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

And dont forget to create your superuser to access Django admin!

# P.S SHARING .ENV FILE IN REPO IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE AT ALL. BUT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DATABASE WILL WORK CORRECTLY AND TO NOT DISTURB YOU WITH CREATING YOUR OWN, I WILL SHARE MINE RIGHT IN REPO
